Describe implementation


-> yapÄ±lan testler:
    ls | grep test
    ls -l | sort -k 5
    cd <any directory> 
    exit
    sleep <some time> &
    grep a < test.txt
    cat testing output > testing.txt
    ls | grep test > xd.txt
    grep test < xd.txt | tail -c 9


error reporting could be better, we usually just use EXIT_FAILURE when an error occurs instead of a 
related exit code

Inf buffer problem????? Yoktur herhalde aq.

We prbably have obscure errros for some weird commands. We arent fully aware of all holes


If one inp output or input it requires is too big, an inf buffer may be needed. 
This version is dead simple.
